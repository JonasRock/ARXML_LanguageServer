# ARXML Language Server #

This is the Language Server to work in conjunction with the Visual Studio Code extension [ARXML Navigation Helper](https://github.com/JonasRock/ARXML_NavigationHelper)

It implements the Language Server Protocol, so it should in theory be compatible with any text editor that supports the protocol, although some of the features are implemented using other ways and are not easily portable to other editors.

Building the server manually should not be required when using the extension, as the server executable is bundled with the extension package.
